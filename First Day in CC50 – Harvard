# First Day in CC50 – Harvard

Today I started the **CC50 course**, the translated version of **Harvard’s CS50**, one of the most well-known introductory courses in Computer Science. From the very beginning, I was fascinated, mainly because this is the field I want to pursue in my undergraduate studies (assuming everything goes well and I don’t quit along the way).

## What caught my attention

- The difference between **interpreted languages** (such as Python) and **compiled languages** (such as C).
- How **program compilation** works and what actually happens during program execution.
- Practical exercise: creating the classic **Hello World** program.
  - In **Python**, the script is executed directly.
  - In **C**, I wrote the code and **compiled** it using a compiler to generate an executable program.

## My impressions

It was an excellent start. I am genuinely looking forward to exploring more concepts related to **programming, algorithms, and data structures** in the coming days.

> Each exercise represents one more step in my learning journey in Computer Science.
